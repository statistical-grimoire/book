Since prefaces often go unread, I shall keep this brief. This text was born out of a need to offer my students a robust, open-access (i.e., free) introduction to R, specifically for those without any programming experience. Long term it is intended to serve as a practical, open-access manual, guiding complete beginners through both statistics and statistical programming in a thorough and clear manner. Please consider everything herein a work in progress.

\noindent Foolish Assumptions Made by Your Author:
\normalsize\normalfont
\begin{itemize}
    \item Students will read this (yes, I'm an optimist).
    \item The reader probably hates math, but realizes that math is like physical exercise - necessary, but rarely enjoyable and often exhausting.
    \item Beginners with R and programming will start this book at the beginning and move sequentially through the topics (because skipping ahead would be like casting spells without learning the basics - dangerous and confusing).
    \item Readers will not take the sillier things I say in this book too seriously.
\end{itemize}
