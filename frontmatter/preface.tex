Since prefaces often go unread, I shall keep this brief. This text was born out of a need to offer my students a robust, open-access introduction to R, specifically for those without any programming experience. Long term it is intended to serve as a practical, open-access manual, guiding complete beginners through both statistics and statistical programming in a thorough and clear a manner. Please consider everything herein a work in progress.
