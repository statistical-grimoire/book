Since prefaces often go unread, I shall keep this brief. This text was born out of a need to offer my students a robust, open-access (i.e., free) introduction to R, specifically for those without any programming experience. Long term it is intended to serve as a practical, open-access manual, guiding complete beginners through both statistics and statistical programming in a thorough and clear manner. Please consider everything herein a work in progress.

\noindent Foolish Assumptions Made by Your Author:
\normalsize\normalfont
\begin{itemize}
    \item You will actually read this (yes, I'm an optimist).
    \item You probably don’t like math. You might even fear it, but deep down, you know it’s good for you. Math, like exercise, is rarely pleasant but often necessary.
    \item You’ll start at the beginning and move forward. Because jumping ahead is like summoning something you don’t understand. It will arrive—and you won’t like what it brings.
    \item You won’t take my jokes too seriously. Especially the ones that sound a little too real.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Errata:
\normalsize\normalfont
\begin{itemize}
\item No manuscript, however cursed or consecrated, is free from the creeping taint of error. Should you unearth any horrors—do not consign your discovery to silence. Instead, record your findings within the digital vaults of GitHub, where the keeper of this tome may attempt to contain and exorcise the corruption...before it spreads further.
