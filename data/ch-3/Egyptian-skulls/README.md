# **Comparative data on male Egyptian skulls**

## Description

This repository contains datasets with measurements of male Egyptian skulls originally collected and published by Arthur Thomson and David Randall-MacIver in their 1905 work, Ancient Races of the Thebaid. The data were later compiled and republished in Multivariate Statistical Methods: A Primer by Bryan F.J. Manly, which serves as the immediate source for the current datasets.

- `Thomson_Randall-MacIver_1905.csv`: Full dataset compiled from Manly's work.

- `Max_Breadth_TRM_1905.csv`: Subset containing only maximal breadth measurements (in wide format).

## Format

Both files are provided in CSV (comma-separated values) format.

**year**

- Historical date as an integer for numerical sorting. Negative values indicate BCE, positive values indicate CE (e.g., `-3300` = 3300 BCE, `150` = 150 CE).

**year_numeric**

- Historical date listing as an interger for numerical sorting. Negative values indicate BCE, positive CE.

**mb**

- Maximum breadth in millimeters.

**bh**

- Basibregmatic height in millimeters.

**bl**

- Basialveolar length in millimeters.

**nh**

Nasal height in millimeters.

## Details

Measurements were taken from male Egyptian skulls excavated in the Thebes region. The original data collection methods reflected early 20th-century anthropological standards, which may differ from contemporary best practices. Users should be mindful of the historical context, recognizing potential biases or limitations in the sampling methods and measurement procedures.
