\chapter{The Echo of Catacombs - Central Tendency and Spread}

\IMFellEnglish
\lettrine[lines=5, realheight]{W}{hen} we seek to understand a dataset as a thing unto itself, we are engaging in nothing short of an act of necromancy. It is an attempt to give voice to something that is potentially vast, shapeless, and even dead. We cannot see the thing's full form; we are too small, too insignificant, and the catacombs stretch too deep. But we can listen. We can measure its echoes. 

These are not the thing itself, but the traces it leaves in the air as it moves past us. These measures do not reveal the full anatomy of the creature; they offer only its shadow on the wall, its weight in the dust, its shriek retreating into the stone. And yet, rely on them we must. They are how we pretend to understand the whole, even when what we see is only a sliver of the crypt.

\section{A Practical Problem}

Consider the full set of craniometric data provided by \textcite{Thomson1905}. The data file is called \R{Thomson\_Randall-MacIver\_1905.csv}\footnote{The data file can be obtained at this book's GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/statistical-grimoire/book/blob/main/data/Egyptian-skulls}} and portions of it were used to illustrate some features of plotting and data manipulation in Chapter 3.
